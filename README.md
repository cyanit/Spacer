Spacer is a simple program that lets you organize your Taskbar through spaces.

Since the app is not signed, it may show a security alert or trigger your antivirus.

## How to use
You can use it in two different ways:

### 1: Copy & Attach
1. Store the exe in any directory
2. Drag the exe to your taskbar to create a shortcut
3. Copy the exe, rename it and repeat until you have enough spacers

### 2: Shortcuts
Make a shortcut to the exe and pin that to your taskbar.
Make a different one (different name!) and repeat.

## Tipps
- Store the exe's/shortcut's in one folder within your "Documents" folder. This way you wont clutter up your Desktop / Documents.
- click on the "by cyanit" for the about page
- combine Spacer with "Classic Shell" for a transparent taskbar

Keep in mind that a click on the spacer will open the programm.

If you have a dark wallpaper, you should customize the icon (the svg is within the resources). Im working on a switch though.
