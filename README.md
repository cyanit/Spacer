# Spacer
Spacer is a simple program that lets you organize your Taskbar through spaces.

## Download
Click [HERE](https://github.com/cyanit/Spacer/raw/master/Spacer%20v1.exe) to download the binary.

## How to use
You can use it in two different ways:

### 1: Shortcuts
Make a shortcut to the exe and pin that to your taskbar.
Make a different one (different name!) and repeat.

### 2: Copy & Attach
Pin the exe via drag and drop to your taskbar.
Copy the exe (different name!) and repeat.

## Tipps
- Store the exe's/shortcut's in one folder within your "Documents" folder. This way you wont clutter up your Desktop / Documents.
- click on the "by cyanit" for the about page
- combine Spacer with "Classic Shell" for a transparent taskbar

Keep in mind that a click on the spacer will open the programm.

If you have a dark wallpaper, you should customize the Icons (the svgs are within the resources). Im working on a switch though.
